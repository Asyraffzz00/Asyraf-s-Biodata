        no such thing as a perfect car for everyone as the needs and preferences of each differ from one another. However, I have a theory that if you plot a Venn diagram of the common needs of most Malaysian car buyers, one of the cars sitting at the intersection is the 2022 Honda Civic.

        Powered by a Passion; refined in its technology and power. Inspired by a Legacy;
